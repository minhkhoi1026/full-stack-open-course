# TypeScript

> TypeScript being a superset of JavaScript means that it includes all the features of JavaScript and its own additional features as well

TypeScript consists of three separate, but mutually fulfilling parts:
- The language: consists of syntax, keywords and type annotations.
- The compiler (transpiler): is responsible for type information erasure (i.e. removing the typing information) and the code transformations.
- The language Service: collects type information from the source code. Development tools can use the type information for providing intellisense, type hints and possible refactoring alternatives.
